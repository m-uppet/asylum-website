        Asylum 669 was formed fairly recently with the intention of making people feel like they're actually apart of a community,
not just another number to buff up a member count. You could say we're out here to spite overly large, mammoth communities
with no 'home' feeling. You're right, we are.
<br><br>
So who are we? We're a dark, twisted community with horrible intentions, but we're honestly the best out there no competition.
We ~might~ want you, emphasis on might, we are very picky with whom we choose which some would say makes us elitist cunts.
However! We continue to grow each day with members we value and support - those who we deem good enough to stay.
<br><br>
Whether you like to QP for fun or comp seriously, you like 1v1 or deathmatch, you wanna arcade or even enjoy pugs with awesome people then this is the place for you!
That is not all…we play other games as well like Diablo, League and Destiny 2 
That is still not all…we have our own streaming website where we host weekly movie nights!

If this is enough to sway you into sacrificing yourself to a vile and twisted cause then you're right for us. Come to the darkside 
motherfuckers.

        <p>Hey Hey! So some might know me as HitLikeAGirl/
            CHOKEME
            /SPANKME in game but I usually go by Melbie. I'm 22 and my favourite food is pizza... noodles.. nugz.. The list is too big.

I am the owner of the server so basically "The Disease" that runs through and runs this place. I handle marketing, recruitment, ranks, events and everything social related. Basically before anyone can join they have to go through me first!

            Sup, my name is Eplejus but you can call me Apple. I'm 26 years old and not a human anymore cause they replaced my old heart with a new one.
I am an admin "Warden" for Asylum 669 and i'm the tech guy for the server. Handling everything discord related and helping with whatever coding experience i have. I also do everything Melbie won't and can't do. So i'd say i'm an all around kinda admin.
